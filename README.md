# Message-Encryption-Decryption-Uisng-CPP
These are two little separate pieces of code written in cpp, one represents encryption of the string or a message entered by user along with the encrption key that is a number and one for the decryption of that string with the same encryption key. We can encrypt an entire message with a key number and send to another person without a key. That person can only decrypt that message if he or she knows the key number. we can keep that message secret and we can put conditional access for decryption on that message. Procedure :
1) Firstly open the encryption code and run it.
2) Next, enter a string or a message which you want to enter.
3) It will ask for an encryption key number. Enter any number, between 1 to 10 will work fine.
4) After this the code will show the encrypted message along with encryption key number.
5) Now open the decryption code and run this.
6) It will ask to enter the encrypted message or string.
7) Copy that message or string form previous code and enter it here.
8) Now in order to decrypt the message the encryption key is required. Put the encryprion key form privious code, the encrypted message or string will appear in its original form.
9) Note that it is highly necessary to put the excat encryption key here, otherwise the message or string will not be decrypted by the program.
10) Only the user who knows the key will be able to decrypte the string or message.
